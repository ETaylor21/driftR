The goal of `driftR` is to correct continuous water-quality monitoring data for intramental drift.

## Installation

`driftR` is not available from CRAN yet. In the meantime, you can install the development version of `driftR` from Github with devtools:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("shaughnessyar/driftR")
```

## Background

The `driftR` package implements a series of equations used in [Dr. Elizabeth Hasenmueller's](https://hasenmuellerlab.weebly.com) hydrology and geochemistry research. These equations correct continuous water-quality monitoring data for incramental drift that occurs over time. There are two forms of corrections included in the package - a one-point calibration and a two-point calibration. One-point and two-point callibration values are suited for different types of measurements. 

The package is currently written for the easiest use with YSI Sonde products. We will be adding a vignette in the future describing the application of this package to other brands of water monitoring sensors.

## Usage

As shown, continuous water-quality instrument drift over time, so it becomes necessary to correct the data to maintain accuracy. First, you start with importing the data with `dr_readSonde()`. Next, you apply a correction factor using `dr_correct()`. Then, utilizing the generated correction factors, you use either `dr_clean1()` or `dr_clean2()` to drift correct the data using 1 or 2 point calibrations respectively. Lastly, you would `dr_drop()` data to account for instrument equilibration. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# load the driftR package
library(driftR)

# import data exported from a Sonde 
dataFrame <- dr_readSonde("filePath/data.csv", define=TRUE)

# calculate correction factor
correct <- dr_correct(dataFrame, Date, Time, format = YMD)

# apply one-point calibration to SpConde
dataFrame$SpCond_clean <- dr_clean1(df, SpCond, 1.07, 1, correct)

# drop observations to account for instrument equilibration
dataFrame <- dr_drop(dataFrame, head=10, tail=5)
```

See the [package website](https://shaughnessyar.github.io/driftR/) for details on these functions and a [detailed vignette]() describing their use.
