Description: An implamentation of data correction for instramental drift in continuous water- 
    quality monotoring data. There are many sources of water-quality data including private 
    (ex: YSI instruments) and open source (ex: USGS and NDBC), each of which are susceptible 
    to errors/inaccuracies due to drift. This package allows the user to correct their data 
    using one or two standard reference values in a uniform, reproducible way.
